@misc{StepperServo,
abstract = {The basic difference between a traditional stepper and stepper-vs-servo.jpga servo-based system is the type of motor and how it is controlled. Steppers typically use 50 to 100 pole brushless motors while typical servo motors have only 4 to 12 poles. A pole is an area of a motor where a North or South magnetic pole is generated either by a permanet magnet or by passing current through the coils of a winding. Steppers don't require encoders since they can accurately move between their many poles whereas servos, with few poles, require an encoder to keep track of their position. Steppers simply move incrementally using pulses [open loop] while servo's read the difference between the motors encoder and the commanded position [closed loop], and adjust the current required to move.},

The proposed design concept and method an effective analysis of historic airship structures considering their efficiency vs. weight and desired performances. By this analysis a novel structural design has been defined to reach the ambitious goal of a lighter and cheaper structure concept which can ensure comparable performances with traditional rigid airships. A discoid shaped airship with a central column has been taken into account. Structural calculations and constructive design has been presented in depth. {\textcopyright} 2012 SAE International.},

Generally underpowered, underactuated, and large in size, airships express difficulties in adverse atmospheric conditions or situations requiring rapid or precise maneuvers. In this paper, a miniature unmanned airship with a moving platform is presented to address the the limited altitude maneuverability of these vehicles. Simulated and experimental open-loop trajecto- ries demonstrate that this architecture allows for large changes in vehicle pitch and, when combined with forward facing thrusters, rapid changes in altitude. Operational advantages such as increased hull rigidity and concentrated hardware inherent to the vehicle design are also discussed. I.},

Using a simplified dynamic model derived with experimentally derived coefficients, two trajectory planning simulations are solved using optimal control. The generated trajectories are then evaluated experimentally on a micro airship to demonstrate that optimal control can be used in open loop over short distances.

The purpose of this research is to develop a dynamic model for the purpose of guidance, navigation, and control techniques of autonomous airships. The tri-turbofan simulation environment is a first principle force-based model which makes use of a 6-degree of freedom nonlinear equation of motion of an airship. Also, the tri-turbofan simulation environment calculates the linear longitudinal and lateral-directional models around the velocity trim points. A graphical user interface was developed in MATLAB and an open loop nonlinear Simulink model was integrated into the graphical interface. Finally, the Tri-Turbofan simulation was verified against flight test data acquired using the VICON optical measurement system. This paper illustrates the use of the Tri-Turbofan simulation environment by integrating a simple velocity hold autopilot into a linear longitudinal model of the airship.},

abstract = {Blimps are a promising platform for aerial robotics and have been$\backslash$nstudied extensively for this purpose. Unlike other aerial vehicles,$\backslash$nblimps are relatively safe and also possess the ability to loiter$\backslash$nfor long periods. These advantages, however, have been difficult$\backslash$nto exploit because blimp dynamics are complex and inherently non-linear.$\backslash$nThe classical approach to system modeling represents the system as$\backslash$nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on Newtonian principles.$\backslash$nA more recent modeling approach is based on representing state transitions$\backslash$nas a Gaussian process (GP). In this paper, we present a general technique$\backslash$nfor system identification that combines these two modeling approaches$\backslash$ninto a single formulation. This is done by training a Gaussian process$\backslash$non the residual between the non-linear model and ground truth training$\backslash$ndata. The result is a GP-enhanced model that provides an estimate$\backslash$nof uncertainty in addition to giving better state predictions than$\backslash$neither ODE or GP alone. We show how the GP-enhanced model can be$\backslash$nused in conjunction with reinforcement learning to generate a blimp$\backslash$ncontroller that is superior to those learned with ODE or GP models$\backslash$nalone.},

Operational advantages such as increased hull rigidity and concen-trated hardware inherent to the vehicle design are also discussed.},

In order to improve the gas storage density and specific energy of RFC further, this paper put forward a kind of RFC with low pressure gasbags to store hydrogen (H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and oxygen (O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) by the use of the huge volume of the airship. The calculation model of airship general parameters was established based on the weight balance and the energy balance equations. Studies have shown that after using gasbag gas storage method, the H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} storage density was up to 15.5{\%} and the O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} storage density was up to 74.6{\%}. Compared with the common RFC, the RFC with gasbags made the total weight of airship decreased by 19{\%}. Under the same total weight, the RFC with gasbags made the payload of the airship increased by 94{\%}. Therefore, the RFC with gasbags has great advantages and feasibility on the near space hybrid power airship.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {The control of a new kind of airship is presented. By restricting its flight to a vertical plane, the mathematical model is reduced. The simplified model is proved to be minimum phase, and a nonlinear controller based on inputoutput linearization is designed. Since the performance of the controller is significantly impacted by the choice of parameters, simulations of three different pole placement strategies are presented. The nonlinear controller shows better performances than a linear LQR controller when the initial condition is significantly away from the desired equilibrium.},

@article{shigley,
abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},
