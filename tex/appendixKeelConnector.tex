\section{Keel Connector Diamond}
This is an extension of the keel analysis Section \ref{connector}. The main analysis is done that section since the piece can be modified. The diamond part of the connector is at a fixed size since any changes would cause it to interfere with the wheels on the gondola. It is made from the same piece of aluminium as the square part and has a much higher safety factor than the square piece. The analysis was still done to show that it can withstand the loading. The worst case scenario is the same as the one done for buckling shown in Figure \ref{fig:armConnectorBuck}. The piece undergoes shear stress at the centre of the piece, given by Equation \ref{eqn:keelConnector}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:keelConnector}
\tau_{yz} = \frac{VQ}/{Ib};
\end{equation}
