Introduction Paragraph
\section{Gondola}
The gondola sub-assembly is the most distinguishable feature of the airship design. The gondola moves along the keel in order to rapidly pitch the airship. Key components can be seen in FIGURE???????. Movement along the gondola is driven by two friction wheels which interface with the cover on the keel through the friction between the two surfaces. Bearings are used as wheel to hold the gondola on top of the keel, while the friction wheel are in contact with the bottom edge of the keel. The gondola is comprised of two half sections which each house components, such as the battery, flight controller, transmitter, GPS module and two ESCs. Joining the two sections is a hinge, which allows the gondola to bend in the centre. The bend in the middle allows the gondola to overcome a more significant turning radius compared to being fixed in a straight line. Similarly to curve fitting, the more points that are used, the better fit. Braking of the gondola is accomplished by turning the friction wheels in the opposite direction and the position is held by a linear actuator. The gondola has been designed to be resistant to small amounts of water, considering the gondola will always be shielded from rainfall by the envelope, therefore total waterproofing is not required. The gondola section are made using high quality 3D prints, given their complex geometries and relatively small size.
\\
\subsection{Friction Wheel}
The friction wheel is made from 55D rubber, purchased off-the-shelf so it can deform when it is placed on the keel. A shaft adapter is necessary to bridge the gap between the motor shaft and the friction wheel, as the two sizes are not compatible. The shaft adapter will be 3D printed, and held in place by an existing set screw in the friction wheel. To ensure adequate pressure on the keel, the friction wheel assembly is mounted on a hinged bracket equipped with a torsion spring at the pin, as seen in FIGURE???????. The motor used can rotate in both directions, making it useful as a brake also. A magnetic encoder can be seen in FIGURE????, allowing for accurate positioning of the gondola sections, independently allowing for redundancy between the two motors. The motor is mounted to the bracket using two nuts and two bolts. The bracket is mounted to the gondola using 2 nuts, 2 bolts and 2 washers. The bracket and hinge will be manufactured in house with a sourced torsion spring.
\\
\subsection{Bearings}
Bearings are placed on top of the keel to support the weight of the gondola and counter the force applied to the keel by the friction wheel. The bearings act as wheels turning and slipping along the keel. Low weight, plastic bearings will be used. The bearings are mounted using a snap fit design where the bearing is held in place by a diameter slightly larger than its own. The bearing is placed over the piece, deflecting it until the bearing can slip past the overhang where the snap fit piece elastically snaps back into its original position, securely holding the bearing.
\\
\subsection{Linear Actuator}
A linear actuator is housed on one of the two sections of the gondola. The linear actuator is to be activated when the gondola is not moving to hold its position on the keel. A custom 3D printed piece is outfitted to the top of the actuator in a V-shape to mesh ideally with the keel, as seen in FIGURE???????. The V-shaped 3D printed surface will then be coated with a Plasti Dip${\textregistered}$ like coating, to reduce the likelihood of tearing the polyurethane cover on the keel.  The  linear actuator chosen has a holding force of 45N without constant power, making it ideal for run time. It is also water resistant to the IP54 standard. 
\\
\subsection{Door and Components}
The gondola features a sliding door, to ease the process of component charging and changing. The door relies upon an interference fit to stay in place and components are placed on top of the door once it is half closed. See FIGURE????? (selective cross-section). The door will be 3D printed also.
\\
\section{Keel}
FIGURE????? shows the keel assembly. The two straight and one curved sections of the keel and the envelope support originate from Dr. Lanteigne's design. Sections of the keel are joined using connectors that rely on interference fits, also designed by Dr. Lanteigne, but modified and machined for better material properties. The envelope support slides into a slot on the keel connectors remaining in position by bottoming out. Thrusters are mounted on carbon fibre arms that also slide into the connector, maintaining position by bottoming out as well. 3D printed end stops are inserted in either end of the keel using an interference fit identical to the connectors. These stops are slightly larger than the size of the keel, effectively interfering with the gondola wheels, keeping it from rolling off the ends of the keel. All geometries in the keel assembly are fixed in relation to the airship with the exception of the thrusters.
\\
\subsection{Thrusters}
The thruster arms are made from carbon fibre that will be made in house by laying sheets of carbon fibre on a balloon mold. A CNC machined aluminum plate is attached to the U-shaped carbon fibre arms by welding a machined cap piece onto the plate, then inserting the carbon fibre arm into it and applying epoxy. FIGURE ???? shows and exploded view of the overall assembly. Components are housed inside a 3D printed casing that features a 3D printed door, similar to the gondola, see FIGURE???????????. The components for each thruster include, a receiver, a battery and a BESC. The components are located above the centre of volume in the z-direction, raising the centre of mass. These components are well covered from the rain and any splashing water. With the casing above the servo motor, the servo motor is shielded from rain in normal flying conditions.\\

 A servo motor is mounted to the plate using aluminum blocks along with off-the-shelf assembly, as seen in FIGURE?????. A bearing and custom machined housing are added to the off-the-shelf to support the shaft attached to the servo motor. The shaft will be machined to hollow, threaded on the outside and a shoulder that fits into the bearing inner race. The shaft is mounted to the spline on the servo, and an M3 screw is placed inside to shaft, axially fastening it to the servo, as the servo comes standard with a tapped hole. Several screws are used to securely fasten the servo to the supporting parts.\\

The thruster motor is mounted on a machined mounting bracket with tapped holes using hex screws, which is mounted on the shaft using washers and nuts. The propeller is mounted to the motor using a standard interference fit, given that these are both off-the-shelf parts. The propeller and motor are protected by a lightweight encasement (MANUFACTURED HOW????) that is mounted to the shaft by squeezing the plastic between a shoulder on the shaft and washer/nut combination. The encasement provides shielding of the propeller motor during forward flight conditions.\\
