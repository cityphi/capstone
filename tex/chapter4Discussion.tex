Discussion and Critical Review of Design aka Talk shit about ourselves

- absurd number of interference fits (gondola hinge cap, bearing mounting on thruster, gondola and casing door, propeller, keel connectors, end stops)
- envelope design not specific, relying on soul patch to design
- snap-fits for bearing not ideal
- over engineering many things, not enough parameters
-  motors in the solidworks cannot change, they vary too much to accurately depict them
- some things are only aesthetic, like the rshaft thread, motor mounting bracket, propeller
- servo mounting bracket is fucked up complicated to assembly
- too... many...fasteners...
- glueing component casing, glueing thruster arms to envelope
- shaft adapter for friction wheel, not great. use motor with bigger shaft size or smaller friction wheel
- friction wheel coefficient of friction is not legit, estimated at something that could be good-ish?
- wayyyyyy too much 3D printing, weights and material properties not great. very dependent on the print orientation.
- difficult to manufacture carbon fibre in house, see quote for China keel manufacturing.
- cable glands not totally accurate, none could be found that small. also only good for one wire, many going in at once.
- did not waterproof well. thruster motor is totally exposed.
- 3D model did not reflect wiring. Wiring not so great. no consideration for how wires will be managed inside casings. wire passing through thruster shaft significantly decreases the ease of assembly.
